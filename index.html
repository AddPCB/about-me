        <h1>This is my about me page.</h1>

        <p>
          My name is Peter Brightmore, and I am an experienced hospitality professional and aspiring software developer.
          <br>
          Throughout my decade-long hospitality career, I have shown a knack for problem solving and meeting targets without the need for oversight.
          <br>
          This enabled me to rise to the role of Head Chef, despite not having the relevant formal training or education.
        </p>

        <p class="more-content">
          As Head Chef, I successfully led a small team in turning around a struggling kitchen, and I was instrumental in implementing standards and protocols that resulted in a flawless 5* hygiene accreditation. 
          <br>
          Along with my perfect attendance and punctuality, the project management skills I developed to deliver on due diligence, staff rotas, menu writing, and other office tasks made me a dependable asset, and will easily transfer to future roles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the start of the pandemic, I have been looking to capitalize on my ADHD, rather than hide it as I did in hospitality. 
          <br>
          To that end, I am in the process of transitioning into software development, and I am currently in the second week of a full stack JavaScript boot camp. 
          <br>
          I have 7 GCEs A-C, and some college education. I have attempted to become a CISCO certified network associate, but my work commitments have previously prevented me from completing this course.
          <br />
          I am both a fast reader and typist, and I enjoy reading a variety of novels, news, and science journals. 
          <br>
          When not reading, I can often be found debating advances in tech and current events.
        </p>
        <p id="some-more-content">
          My goals are to build a strong foundational knowledge of the tools, operators, and logic that form the basis of success in software development, and then become self-reliant in the industry by the second quarter of 2023. 
          <Br>
          Through this, I hope to make full use of my resourcefulness, creativity, and drive, which have been integral to my success in the hospitality industry.
