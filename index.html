    <h1>This is my about me page.</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Peter Brightmore, 
  <br>
  I am an experienced hospitality professional and an aspiring software developer.
  <br>
  Throughout my hospitality career, spanning over a decade, I have demonstrated a knack for problem-solving and meeting targets without oversight.
  <br>
  This permitted my rise to Head Chef, despite lacking the relevant formal training or education.
  </p>

  <p class="more-content">
    In my role as head chef, I successfully led a small team in turning around a struggling kitchen, and I was instrumental in implementing standards and protocols that resulted in a flawless 5* hygiene accreditation. 
    <br>
    Taken together with my perfect attendance and punctuality, the project management skills I developed to deliver on due diligence, staff rotas, menu writing, and other office tasks made me a dependable asset, and will transfer easily to future roles. 
    <br>
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Since the start of the pandemic, I have been looking to capitalize on my ADHD, rather than hide it as i did in Hospitality.
    <br>
    To that end, I am currently transitioning into software development, and I am in the second week of a full stack JavaScript boot camp.
    <br>
    I have 7 GCEs A-C, and some college education. 
    <br>
    I have attempted to become a CISCO certified network associate, but my work commitments have previously held me back from completing this course. 
    <br>
    I am both a fast reader and typist, and I enjoy reading a variety of novels, news, and science journals.
    <br>
    When not reading i can often be found debating advances in tech and current events.
    </p>
    <p id="some-more-content">
    My goals are to build a strong foundational knowledge of the tools, operators and logic that form the basis of success, then become self-reliant in the industry by Q2 2023. 
    <br>
    Through this, I hope to truly make use of my resourcefulness, creativity and drive, which have been integral to my success in the hospitality industry.</p>
