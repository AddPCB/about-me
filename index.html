    <h1>This is my about me page.</h1>

   <p class="more-content">
    My name is Peter Brightmore, 
   <br>
   I am an experienced hospitality professional and an aspiring software developer.
   <br>
   Throughout my hospitality career, spanning over a decade, I have demonstrated a knack for problem-solving and meeting targets without oversight. 
   This permitted my rise to Head Chef, despite lacking the relevant formal training or education.
  </p>

    <p class="more-content">
      In my role as head chef, I successfully led a small team in turning around a struggling kitchen, and I was instrumental in implementing standards and protocols that resulted in a flawless 5* hygiene accreditation. 
    <br>
    I also managed due diligence, staff rotas, menu writing, and other office-based tasks. 
    <br>
    My perfect attendance and punctuality made me a dependable asset.</p>
    
    <p id="some-more-content">Since the start of the pandemic, I have been looking to capitalize on my ADHD, rather than hide it. To that end, I am currently transitioning into software development, and I am in the second week of a full stack JavaScript boot camp. My goals are to build a strong foundational knowledge of the tools, operators and logic that form the basis of success, then become self-reliant in the industry by Q2 2023. Through this, I hope to truly make use of my resourcefulness, creativity and drive, which have been integral to my success in the hospitality industry.</p>
