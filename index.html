        <h1>This is my about me page.</h1>

        <p>
          My name is Peter Brightmore,
          <br />
          I am an experienced hospitality professional and an aspiring software
          developer.
          <br />
          Throughout my hospitality career, spanning over a decade, I have
          demonstrated a knack for problem-solving and meeting targets without
          oversight.
          <br />
          This permitted my rise to Head Chef, despite lacking the relevant
          formal training or education.
        </p>

        <p class="more-content">
          In my role as head chef, I successfully led a small team in turning
          around a struggling kitchen, and I was instrumental in implementing
          standards and protocols that resulted in a flawless 5* hygiene
          accreditation.
          <br />
          Taken together with my perfect attendance and punctuality, the project
          management skills I developed to deliver on due diligence, staff
          rotas, menu writing, and other office tasks made me a dependable
          asset, and will transfer easily to future roles.
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the start of the pandemic, I have been looking to capitalize on
          my ADHD, rather than hide it as i did in Hospitality.
          <br />
          To that end, I am currently transitioning into software development,
          and I am in the second week of a full stack JavaScript boot camp.
          <br />
          I have 7 GCEs A-C, and some college education.
          <br />
          I have attempted to become a CISCO certified network associate, but my
          work commitments have previously held me back from completing this
          course.
          <br />
          I am both a fast reader and typist, and I enjoy reading a variety of
          novels, news, and science journals.
          <br />
          When not reading i can often be found debating advances in tech and
          current events.
        </p>
        <p id="some-more-content">
          My goals are to build a strong foundational knowledge of the tools,
          operators and logic that form the basis of success, then become
          self-reliant in the industry by Q2 2023.
          <br />
          Through this, I hope to truly make use of my resourcefulness,
          creativity and drive, which have been integral to my success in the
          hospitality industry.
